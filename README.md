📌 ML Models Repository — Overview

This repository is a practical collection of machine learning models implemented from scratch using real-world datasets. Each notebook focuses on a specific algorithm and dataset, demonstrating the complete workflow—from data understanding and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

Rather than being purely theoretical, these projects emphasize hands-on learning and applied data science, making this repository a strong reference for students, practitioners, and recruiters looking to understand how classical machine learning models are built and evaluated in practice.

🧠 How These Models Were Built — Methodology Overview

Across all notebooks, the modeling process follows a consistent and industry-relevant workflow:

1. Dataset Understanding
   Each project begins with exploring the dataset, understanding features, and identifying potential data quality issues.

2. Data Preprocessing
   Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features (when required), and preparing data for modeling.

3. Model Selection and Training
   Appropriate machine learning algorithms are selected based on the problem type (classification, regression, or clustering) and trained using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas,      Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

4. Model Evaluation
   Performance is measured using relevant metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision-recall, R² score, and error metrics.

5. Interpretation and Insights
   Each notebook includes observations explaining model behavior, feature importance, and real-world implications of the results.
